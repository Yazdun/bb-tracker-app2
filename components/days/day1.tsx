        I built this website today. I was working at my day job until around 7
        PM, then I spent an hour or two cleaning, playing some chess, getting
        dinner, and spending time on X.
      </p>

      <p>
        I started working on this website around 11 AM. I've been wanting to
        build this site so I can easily track my progress at the end of the
        challenge and see what I did right and wrong, and how much time I spent
        on hunting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then I went through some public bb programs and picked ~20 that seemed
        interesting to me.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally I need to be interested in a company to hunt on their program.
        otherwise I get frustrated halfway and give up.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I went through each company's website, checked their assets, etc.
      </p>

      <p>
        I narrowed it down to 8 programs. I also picked 2 companies that don't
        have bug bounty programs but interest me.
      </p>

      <p>So right now, I have 10 candidates to hunt on.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow, I'm going to pick 2 of them and start doing recon.</p>
