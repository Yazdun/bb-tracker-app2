      <p>
        Since June, I&apos;ve started taking cybersecurity a bit more seriously.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, I was in the worst shape of my life, both mentally and
        physically.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hunting isn&apos;t new to me. I&apos;ve found vulnerabilities here and
        there, done pentesting at work & collected some bounties over the years.
      </p>

      <p>Still, I’m an amateur.</p>

      <p>
        See, I had a failed startup on my hand and I only realized how tight
        that product was tied to my ego short after I let it go.
      </p>

      <p>
        I commonly had panic attacks and anxiety attacks, my brain was covered
        in a thick dark fog.
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually, this was my second attempt to build something great, which
        blew up in my face again.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;m grateful to God for having my partner during that time, as she
        saved me from being fully consumed by dark evil of resentment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since June, while I was mostly listening to podcasts, playing chess, and
        watching anime, I also started casually reading vulnerability reports,
        reading a few books on networking and Linux, doing CTFs, and exploring
        public H1 programs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was mainly trying to keep myself busy and wasn&apos;t serious about
        it, but I ended up greatly improving my basic understanding of the web
        and programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        During August and September, I picked up a few H1 programs and started
        doing recon. I found some vulnerabilities, got a few duplicates & only
        one was triaged for a few hundred bucks.
      </p>

      <p>Still, I was mainly doing this for fun…</p>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve been searching for all sorts of stuff without any methodology.
      </p>

      <p>XSS, CSRF, SSRF, RCEs, IDORs, you name it.</p>

      <p>
        Jumping from one program to another and doing as many CTFs as I can.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was also very hard for me to stay consistent because I had anxiety
        attacks that would freeze me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I would end up staring at my laptop screen for hours or just getting
        back into bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        But gradually anxiety attacks went away, I started working out & feeling
        better.
      </p>

      <p>
        In October, I began running out of money and needed to look at the job
        market.
      </p>

      <p>I applied for 4 positions…</p>

      <p>Got 3 interviews…</p>

      <p>And received 3 job offers!</p>

      <p>Interesting, definitely a sign that my brain’s worki</p>
